"""Core value types shared across dialects and the diff engine.

The original build plan sketched a ``TableRef`` and a ``Segment`` dataclass. Neither
survived contact with the implementation: the engine takes a dialect, a
table name and a key as separate arguments rather than bundling them, and a
segment is a plain ``(lo, hi)`` tuple whose checksums live in the dict the
dialect returns. They were carried unused for a while, which is worse than
not having them - an unused public dataclass invites someone to build on it
and then drift out of sync with what the code really does.
