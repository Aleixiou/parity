**Prove two tables in two different database engines hold the same data —
without moving the data out of either engine.**

Migrations don't fail on translation. They fail at cutover, because nobody can
prove the new pipeline produces the same data as the old one — so the legacy
system runs in parallel "just to be safe", forever, at double the cost.
`parity` is the proof.

```bash
parity diff \
  --a "postgres://user:pw@legacy-host/warehouse" --a-table public.orders \
  --b "duckdb:///./new.duckdb"                   --b-table main.orders \
  --key order_id
```

```

```

Exit code `1`. Put it in CI and the build fails until the data agrees.

## How it works

`parity` pushes hash aggregation **down into both engines**. It asks each side
for one checksum per bucket of the key range, compares a handful of integers,
recurses only into the buckets that disagree, and downloads rows only from
ranges already proven to differ.

On identical tables it downloads **zero rows** and issues **four queries**,
whether the table has ten thousand rows or ten million.

## Measured

10,000,000 rows per side, PostgreSQL 18.4 ↔ DuckDB 1.5.5, median of five runs
on one developer laptop (`demo/benchmark.py`):

| Scenario | Queries | Rows downloaded | Wall time |
|---|---|---|---|
| identical tables | **4** | **0** (0.0000%) | 25–31s |
| 5 planted differences | **28** | **7,628** (0.0381%) | 48–55s |

**The query counts and row counts are exact and hardware-independent** — they
are properties of the algorithm, and the test suite pins them. Reproduce them
and you should get the same integers.

The wall times are a range across six runs on one developer laptop, and they
vary by about 25% with whatever else that laptop is doing. Treat them as an
order of magnitude, not a specification.

The query count and the rows-downloaded figures are **exact and
hardware-independent** — they are properties of the algorithm, and the test
suite pins them. The wall times are one machine under sustained load; treat
them as an order of magnitude, not a specification.

The five planted differences — a changed decimal, a deleted row, an inserted
row at key 999,999,999, a `NULL` turned into `''`, and a `FALSE` turned into
`NULL` — are all found exactly, with no false positives.

Cost is roughly **one full hash pass per side**. It is CPU-bound on MD5, not
IO-bound on key lookup, which is why **an index on the key column makes no
measurable difference** (measured at 10M: 38.8s without, 37.3s with).
Raising
`--bisection-factor` does not speed up the dominant first pass; it only reduces
round trips on later levels.

## Install

```bash
pip install "parity-diff[all]"        # every engine
pip install "parity-diff[duckdb]"     # DuckDB only — no other driver pulled in
pip install "parity-diff[postgres]"   # PostgreSQL only
pip install "parity-diff[mysql]"      # MySQL only
```

> The PyPI distribution is `parity-diff` — plain `parity` is squatted by an
> empty project. The command you run and the module you import are both
> `parity`.

Python 3.10+. The core has no dependencies; drivers are optional extras and are
imported lazily, so a DuckDB-only user is never made to install `psycopg`.

## Usage

```
parity diff --a CONN --a-table TABLE --b CONN --b-table TABLE --key COL[,COL...]
            [--columns a,b,c] [--exclude x,y]
            [--bisection-factor 32] [--threshold 10000] [--float-scale 6]
            [--max-diffs 100] [--json] [--quiet]
```

**Exit codes** — this is what makes it a CI check:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | identical |
| `1` | differences found |
| `2` | error (bad connection string, missing table, unusable key) |

An error is never `1`. A CI job can always tell "the tables differ" from "the
tool could not run".

Connection strings:

```
postgres://user:password@host:port/database     (also postgresql://)
mysql://user:password@host:port/database
duckdb:///relative/path.duckdb                  (three slashes = relative)
duckdb:////var/lib/warehouse.duckdb             (four slashes = absolute)
duckdb:///C:/data/warehouse.duckdb              (absolute, Windows)
duckdb:///:memory:
```

Table names may be schema-qualified. Unqualified names default to `public` on
PostgreSQL and `main` on DuckDB.

`--json` emits the same content as a machine-readable object, including
`identical`, `truncated`, per-difference values, and the full stats block.

### In CI

```yaml
- name: prove the migration is complete
  run: |
    parity diff \
      --a "$LEGACY_URL"     --a-table public.orders \
      --b "$WAREHOUSE_URL"  --b-table analytics.orders \
      --key order_id --quiet
```

## Using it from Python

The CLI is a thin wrapper. `diff` returns the whole result, so you can act on
it rather than parse output. Importing `parity` pulls in no database driver —
they load when `get_dialect` needs one.

```python
from parity import diff, get_dialect

a = get_dialect("duckdb:///old.duckdb", side="A")
b = get_dialect("duckdb:///new.duckdb", side="B")
try:
    result = diff(a, b, "main.orders", "main.orders", key="id")
finally:
    a.close()
    b.close()

if result.identical:
    print("the tables match")
else:
    for d in result.diffs:
        print(d.kind, d.key, d.columns, d.values_a, d.values_b)

print(f"{result.stats.rows_downloaded} rows crossed the network")
print(f"truncated: {result.truncated}")
```

```
different 2 ['status'] {'status': 'ok'} {'status': 'CHANGED'}
2 rows crossed the network
truncated: False
```

`diff` takes the same options as the CLI: `columns`, `exclude`,
`bisection_factor`, `threshold`, `max_diffs`. Pass `max_diffs=None` to lift the
10,000 default, and `float_scale` to `get_dialect` — both sides must agree or
the comparison is refused before it runs.

### What you get back

`DiffResult` carries:

| Attribute | |
|---|---|
| `identical` | `True` only if nothing differed **and** the whole key space was walked. False whenever `truncated` is set. |
| `truncated` | The walk stopped early, so this is a partial answer. Never read a truncated result as "the rest matched". |
| `diffs` | `RowDiff` objects in key order, each with `key`, `kind` (`only_in_a`, `only_in_b`, `different`), the `columns` that moved, and `values_a` / `values_b` as raw canonical text. |
| `columns` | The columns actually compared, after `columns` and `exclude`. |
| `warnings` | Everything the comparison decided on your behalf: columns skipped, types that differ between sides, timezone-awareness mismatches. Worth surfacing. |
| `float_scale` | The rounding in force, so a caller can state it alongside the verdict. |
| `stats` | `queries`, `rows_downloaded`, `rows_compared_a`, `rows_compared_b`, `segments_checked`, `seconds`. |

`diff` raises `ValueError` for anything it refuses — a non-integer key, a
non-unique or NULL key, a missing table, mismatched float scales. The message
always names which side.

## Limitations — read these before trusting a result

A parity tool that reports a false match is worse than useless, so these are
stated plainly rather than buried.

- **Any key type, but non-integer keys are bucketed by a hash.** A single
  integer column is bisected directly. A `uuid`, a natural string key, or
  several columns together are hashed to 60 bits so the key space can be
  divided — and the run says so. Rows are still matched and reported by their
  real key, so a hash collision can only put two rows in the same bucket; it
  can never merge them.
- **Floats and decimals are compared at 6 decimal places** by default. Two
  values differing only in the 7th place are reported as *equal*. This is a
  deliberate cross-engine rounding contract — the two engines do not otherwise
  agree on float text. Change it with `--float-scale`; it always applies to
  both sides, and the scale in force is printed on every run.
- **Keys must be unique.** A non-unique key is detected up front and rejected.
  Silently collapsing duplicate rows would hide real differences.
- **`Infinity` and `NaN`** in float columns are compared as those literal
  tokens on both sides. A double whose magnitude reaches 1e32 is not supported
  and fails loudly on DuckDB.
- **Wide tables are fine.** PostgreSQL caps a function call at 100 arguments,
  so the row concatenation is built as a nested tree; tested to 500 columns.
- **Supported types:** integer, decimal, float, boolean, string, date,
  timestamp. Anything else is compared as raw text and reported as a warning —
  two engines may render the same JSON or array differently for reasons that
  have nothing to do with the data.
- **At most 10,000 differences are reported by default.** Each one costs about
  715 bytes, so two tables that share nothing would need gigabytes rather than
  producing an answer - and pointing the tool at the wrong table or the wrong
  environment is exactly what it exists to catch. Past the limit the run is
  flagged `truncated`, `identical` is never true, and the output says "at
  least N". It does not mean the rest matched. `--max-diffs 0` lifts the limit.
- **Timezone-aware timestamps are compared as instants, in UTC.** Both
  sessions are pinned to UTC on connect, so the same instant matches whatever
  the two servers' default timezones are. Without that pin, two sides in
  different zones render every `timestamptz` differently and the tool reports
  the entire table as changed.
- Columns present on only one side are skipped with a warning, not treated as
  differences.

## Supported engines

| Engine | Status |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | supported (tested against 16 and 18) |
| DuckDB | supported (tested against 1.5) |
| MySQL | supported (tested against 8.0) |
| Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift | not yet — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a dialect is ~80 lines |

## Scope

In scope: proving two tables match, finding exactly which rows and columns
don't, doing it cheaply on large tables, running in CI.

Deliberately out of scope: data quality rules, freshness checks, anomaly
detection, lineage, cataloguing, orchestration, transformation, a web UI, a
server, schema migration. If a feature does not help someone answer *"can I
safely switch off the old system?"*, it does not belong here.

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1        # Windows;  source .venv/bin/activate elsewhere
pip install -e ".[all]" pytest
pytest
```

Tests that need PostgreSQL read `PARITY_TEST_PG` (default
`postgres://parity:parity@127.0.0.1:5432/parity`) and **skip cleanly** when no
server is reachable — the DuckDB and pure-Python suites still run.

A disposable PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker run -d --name parity-pg -p 55432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=parity -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=parity -e POSTGRES_DB=parity \
  postgres:16-alpine
export PARITY_TEST_PG="postgres://parity:parity@127.0.0.1:55432/parity"
```

Reproduce the benchmark:

```bash
python demo/generate.py --rows 10000000
python demo/benchmark.py --expect-clean
python demo/generate.py --rows 10000000 --plant
python demo/benchmark.py --expect-planted
```

`CLAUDE.md` holds the verified cross-engine SQL and why each expression is the
way it is. `ROADMAP.md` is what is done and what comes next.
